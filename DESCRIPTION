Description: The main function reads in a CR2 image, aggregates it,
    does a PCA on it, and then finds all the cells that are a certain
    Mahalanobis distance away from the average.  It then centers squares
    around those spots and prints them as PDF files into a directory. It
    also keeps around information about where in which images those were
    so that the CR2 images can be extracted using ImageMagick (for example)
    later, for training.
