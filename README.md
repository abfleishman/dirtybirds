This is an R package for performing taking high resolution images (in
raw, CR2 format) and then identifying squares that are outside of the
norm. These are cropped out and placed in a folder so people can
classify them into categories of training data.

## Installation

Do it from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("eriqande/dirtybirds")
```
